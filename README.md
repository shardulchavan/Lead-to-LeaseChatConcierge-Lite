# Lead-to-LeaseChatConcierge-Lite
## üõ†Ô∏è Trade-offs & Next Steps

While the current implementation fulfills the core functionality‚Äîcollecting tenant details, checking inventory, and confirming a tour‚Äîthis version is designed as a "lite" proof-of-concept. To scale toward a more intelligent and autonomous system, several architectural improvements can be introduced:

### üß† Agentic Architecture for Autonomous Workflow

In a future version, we can transition to an **agent-based architecture**, where each discrete task is handled by a specialized agent. For example:

- **Tenant Interaction Agent**: Handles initial chat and guides the user through data collection.
- **FAQ Agent**: Responds to frequently asked questions using a knowledge base.
- **Inventory Agent**: Interfaces with the backend to check real-time availability.
- **Communication Agent**: Constructs and sends tour confirmation emails or SMS.
- **Orchestrator ("Oracle of Thought")**: A meta-agent that routes user queries and actions to the appropriate agent, managing task delegation and memory.

This modularity would:
- Enable scalable parallel development
- Improve response specificity and accuracy
- Move the experience closer to a **zero-human-intervention UX**

### üß© Tooling and Integration

Each agent could be equipped with its own **tools**, such as:
- NLP parsers
- Calendar/tour APIs
- Document readers for lease terms
- External CRMs or databases

This would create a more robust and flexible system architecture, better suited for long-term automation and smarter tenant experiences.
